This was before the [shelter-in-place (social isolation)](https://www.sfchronicle.com/local-politics/article/Bay-Area-must-shelter-in-place-Only-15135014.php) orders went into effect.

## Fun police

Today G proposed going to get dinner. I told them it wasn't a good idea to do so. Nobody argued against me. However, the actions that N and A took were going out to get dinner, which is in direct contrast to what I advised. Nobody argued, but the actions speak for themselves. I feel even *more* guilty for being fun police because of this.

I talked to G about this exact situation in the car as we went to get pizza. We'll see how the meeting later goes.

## Conversation

**I've included ~~screenshots from~~ a transcript of our group message conversation that should appear somewhere in this document.**

`Friday, 4:35 PM`

- G
  - Anyone want to grab dinner later?
- N
  - Me!
- D
  - I might come along
- N
  - Come along D
  - A?
- A
  - Sure
- Me
  - I hate to be a debbie downer here, but is this a good idea?
- D
  - I don't know. But most of my events through June were effectively canceled today and I need a pick me up
- Me
  - (Links CDC page about COVID-19)
- G
  - Jeez, through June?!!
- Me
  - I hate to be that guy, but I'm gonna be that guy: Isn't being in an area with other potentially infected individuals who could spread COVID-19 by spewing droplets via coughing or sneezing, in a *restaurant* where you *directly put things in your mouth*, a good way to *pick up* some corona?
  - I propose seeking out a different method of pick me up
- D
  - Alright fair
- Me
  - Sorry friends
- D
  - If we're gonna start policing where everyone goes, we better have a plan for food, groceries, etc
- B
  - Well, eating out at a restaurant seems like a disproportionately bad idea
- D
  - Are we going to have the party we planned this weekend?
- B
  - Believe me, I want to
  - But the fewer the people at the party, the better
  - I even cancelled all my video game tournament entries
  - We should definitely talk about what to do in this new, unprecedented situation
- D
  - Sigh
  - Maybe we should all talk in person
- B
  - I'm sorry to be the guy who is policing our fun times
  - But I don't want us to get sick from something that is at least somewhat preventable [and in retrospect, I should have said "I also don't want us to spread something whose spread is also easily preventable"]
- D
  - So what's gonna happen for dinner tonight?
- G
  - Maybe we could pick something up?
- B
  - Can we have a meeting when we get home? I think we should discuss the situation (*and* dinner of course)
  - I can pick up food! We can order online, and then we can go pick up all the food from wherever we want
  - Any suggestions? Or should we wait for us all to be home?
- D
  - Good with anything
- B
  - @N what is a place you would want to eat?
- J
  - yeah, i agree, we should talk about it
- B
  - OK, yeah, that sounds good @J. Let's just meet up at home, whenever we get home, and talk about it when we're all together.
- A
  - N and I will get dinner and come home later
- B
  - Rest y'all wanna order something for pickup or delivery?
- G
  - Sure
- B
  - What's on the menu?
- G
  - Pizza?
- B
  - Sounds good. @D @J does this sound good?
- D
  - Ok
- J
  - Sure


## Meeting about Coronavirus Sitch (Situation)

I expressed a few things, but there are a few main points of, or takeaways from, the meeting:

- **I crossed the boundary of telling people what to do.** In my idealism to both protect my housemates from being infected and at least slow the spread of coronavirus in general, I told them that the dinner wasn't a good idea, stopping them from doing a fun activity they wanted to do. *The apparent logical extension* of this is that we all report on what we're doing and ask permission about whether it's OK if, for example, I forgot my lunch, and I need to come back to get it, or if I'm going to get groceries, is that OK. That's not at all what I meant or even wanted, but apparently that's where this line of thinking goes.

- **I implied that they didn't care.** What I *meant* and *thought* I said and explained was that, across the aisle, as a member of the Asian community, in which people are literally staying home and not really allowed to go outside, and only allowed to go outside *sometimes,* it seems like an American doesn't really care (about the spread of the coronavirus or about getting sick or getting other people sick) *relative to* someone in Asia right now. But apparently the **way** I said it implied that the people in the house didn't care at all. Which is obviously not true. I think the exact way I said it was something like, "From a certain perspective, relative to the other side, it feels like *you don't even know what caring is.*" I can see that, even with context, that's just offensive in the sense that I imply that the people I'm talking to don't care at all, which is simply not true. Hell, they cared enough to even have this meeting with me.

There are some other points as well, but the above two were the most drama-inducing and boundary-overstepping. An analogy J made was that "there is some risk in driving a car, and the only way to mitigate that risk is not to drive at all." A perfect analogy because people are still required to go to work no matter what. As an unemployed, job-*seeking* individual, I don't yet have that specific responsibility of needing to go to work, so it's a different perspective for me.

Also, A said something like, "Because we are careful, mindful, and washing our hands and doing basic hygiene things, we are at pretty low risk of getting infected." I outright said I disagree with that--the assumption that we are at low risk of getting infected--because we are exposing ourselves to people who could be asymptomatically infected who could cough or sneeze on us.

He basically said "well, we can't do anything about that because we still have to go to work," to which I said, "damn, the government really isn't doing enough, and should mandate people to stop working" after which he brought up a good point that I truly want to believe:

The point he brought up that was reasonable and that I want to believe is that the people in the government--the CDC, but mainly the infectious disease scientists--are thinking about this and observing the situation basically full-time, and still haven't made any statement like "people should stay indoors." I *did* want to rebut by saying that those officials might have political motivations outside of their pure work role (such as simply trying not to get fired by President Donald Trump), but I felt that *that* in itself was crossing the tin-foil hat boundary, so I literally said "I'm gonna just stop there, because I really want to believe you."

My roommates were kind enough to let me know that it's OK, not wrong, and even right (I have every right) to have these specific worries, but that basically *I* won't change their actions. Which is fine. Every individual has different tolerances for risk, and the fact that my mom's life is directly tied to mine lowers my own tolerance significantly. Not everyone has a tightly bound, pressuring life-string like that.

Earlier, Y told me about a friend(s) who basically said "it'd be safer for me to fly back to Asia because those governments put down some rules, and people follow them; whereas in the U.S., people value their freedoms too much and won't follow [what we perceive to be] basic preventative measures for at least slowing the spread of the virus." Seems ridiculous, right? Why would you fly back to the epicenter of the epidemic? I do see a good point, though, in that people here might not be valuing *enough* the big picture of epidemic, (literal) viral spread. Certain communities of people are more at risk than others, and by interacting in this networked community, *you* could be contributing to the deaths of other people, if not your own.

A also said it was ridiculous, but I forget what he said his reasons were. [I texted him about these reasons](https://github.com/bliutwo/doxx_free_coronavirus_stories/blob/master/07-mar-2020-sat.md).

N mentioned that "so are we supposed to not go outside, stay home?" and also mentioned that that would simply be "not healthy." While I agree that it's not healthy in a normal situation, I wanted to say *yes, that's what people in Asia are doing because it's not a normal situation,* but it's not like that would be convincing to someone living in the U.S. who hasn't directly seen or dealt with the situation in Asia. Moreover, and more importantly, we're not even sure if it's at all a similar situation. **I believe it is** (as a result of my parents' constant influx of articles and chat histories concerning the epidemic, and Y's own networked, Asia community from social media and church), and that's the source of the disagreement, I suppose. The overall perception from my roommates (and probably most people in the U.S.) is that although there's COVID-19 *out there*, the situation isn't much different, if not outright normal. In their minds, COVID-19 doesn't *really* change anything (despite the cancellation of a lot of big public events and gatherings) in our daily lives.

Oh yeah, and I almost forgot this bit that N brought up: *where do we stop in this "we shouldn't go out to eat" line of thought?* If we shouldn't even go out to eat, should we even order food for pickup? You don't *know* if the food workers are hygienic or practice sanitary food preparation. They must have found it super hypocritical that I immediately offered to order out food to eat, since I had just told them off for going out to eat.

There may be more I haven't covered here, but those are the main ideas of what today's coronavirus *drama* was about. I need to immerse myself in my work more, because I am becoming way too sensitive, dramatic, and on edge about *anything* related to the coronavirus.

## Policy going forward

One last thing. I think it was much, much easier for the house to come to an "us vs. H" environment because H continually isolated themselves from us. Sure, there were other, *much* more influential factors, but I think that did contribute a *nonzero* amount. Although I was suspicious that I was a carrier of whatever Y had, I don't think I have symptoms that could cause me to be contagious. Therefore, I should hang out way more in public spaces like the kitchen, family room, and living room. I don't want them to think I'm afraid of them, and I don't want them to be able to easily dehumanize me like it might be if I become a distant, isolated hermit.
