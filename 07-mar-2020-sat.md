I want to study epidemiology. Maybe even get a master's degree in epidemiology. That way, my friends won't just shrug and not believe me when I say "This situation is dire." At least, I want to *know* for certain if an epidemic is a cause for general public concern or not.

## Updates

`TODO:` ~~Put screenshots of text conversation between you and A.~~ DONE!

The ~~images~~ transcript of the text conversation I had with A are on the next pages.

- Me
  - Hey man, I've been trying to keep a faithful journal of what's been going on in my life lately, especially events, feelings, and disagreements surrounding the coronavirus. If you have time, could you remind me what your reasons for thinking that the following statement from some of Y's friends was ridiculous: "It'd be safer for us to fly back to Asia because the governments there put down some rules and people follow them; whereas, in the U.S., people value their freedoms too much and won't follow [what we perceive to be] basic preventative measures for at least slowing the spread of the coronavirus." I remember your reasons being more than just "Why would you fly back to the epicenter of the epidemic?"
- A
  - Just because there are way more cases in Asia even though it's leveling off. So if you follow the same guidelines as those Asian governments but stay here [in the U.S.], your chance of contracting it would be much lower
- Me
  - Thank you
- A
  - It seems like you're trying to side with someone on this, but no one can think for you. You should do your own research and think for yourself
- Me
  - I'm already on the opposite side of all my roommates. Don't worry about me. I've already done both - research and thinking
  - I've done all I can for y'all
  - The main question I asked you is purely for the purpose of preserving people's sentiments and disagreements
- A
  - Ok. I just think it's important to own your beliefs and not correlate agreement with someone to loyalty or respect for that person
- Me
  - Of course that's important. I disagree with you, but respect all of your beliefs and am therefore no longer telling you what you should do. I disagree with you, but I am still loyal to our house, doing everything I can to help you all, such as getting resources for the house in the middle of the night. I'm very aware of the state of the situation between us all. There's no ambiguity or lack of clarity in this sense.
  - But as I said before, I think it's important to preserve the state itself - our discussion, feelings, and disagreements
  - It's not personal
- A
  - I really didn't mean to imply that you aren't loyal to the house or anything like that. I'm sorry it came out that way. I also think it's fine to write about these things. The point I was trying to make was more that I thought you seemed to fall back on your parents for decision making, which I understand, but it makes it harder to reason about things when they're brought into the conversation.
  - Thank you for buying water!
- Me
  - I mean, it's totally fair and reasonable that you would perceive it to be that way, and it's true that the reasons I brought up at the meeting were pretty emotional and tied to the endangerment of my own mother's life. Definitely not easy to reason about that. But keep in mind that my parents are also medical doctors, just like yours. You definitely bring up your dad's advice when you talk about "definitive, safe practices." That's totally fine, and there's nothing wrong with that. I guess I never talk about my parents as "authorities" on the situation, but in fact, they are. I definitely didn't get that point across.
  - My parents constantly send me articles that are not just "their opinions" or "their beliefs." These are articles written by medical professionals actively working to prevent or help prevent the spread. My parents are alumni of doctors in Asia and therefore well connected with the health professionals actively working on the front lines.
  - I'm only sharing with you opinions and advice of not just me, but a network of medical professionals. It's your choice whether or not to consider that advice seriously.
- A
  - Ah that makes sense. I guess I didn't really understand that from what you were saying. I thought it was more like you didn't necessarily agree with your mom but you would feel bad if she knew your housemates were doing these things and putting you in danger.
- Me
  - No, you're completely right. I don't necessarily agree with my mom about everything, and she *does* feel bad knowing that my housemates are doing these things and putting not just me in danger, but themselves and the immediate community in danger, not to mention the global U.S. community. You're completely right.
  - I just stopped because I felt that it wouldn't matter what I say - you were all already in the mindset that I shouldn't tell you what to do.
  - That's your choice, and while I disagree, I respect your decisions

(03-21-2020, 3:00 am) I'll note that I wanted to send another message, saying, nope, that's [a stupid-ass decision, and I don't respect it one bit.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kobJkmUNghI)
