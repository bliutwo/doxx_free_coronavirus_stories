# Doxx-free Coronavirus Personal War Stories 

This is a repo I will use to share journal entries with random people on the Internet.

All files with the ending `.md` are the actual entries. Except this one, of course. You can just click on the `.md` files to read them.

`UPDATE:` I *will* be periodically adding to this repository. It's just that *de-doxxing* entries takes a while. Thanks for your patience!

## Coronavirus - COVID19

I have come to realize that this repository is becoming a compilation of **my personal war stories - the discussions, feelings, and disagreements surrounding the coronavirus (COVID-19).**

If only just to tell my friends, *I told you so.* But, like Alfred, I truly don't want it to get to that point:
